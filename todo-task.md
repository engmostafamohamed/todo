# Todo web application 

## User stories

1 - As a user, I can add tasks
2 -h As a user, I can retrieve my tasks, filter tem by completed and not completed tasks
3 - As a user, I can edit my task's title, description, or change its status completed/not completed
4 - As a user, I can delete/remove a task if I don't need it.

## Data modeling:

```
/*[mandatory field] A unique value that identify a task */
id: any

/*[mandatory field] A task's title. It can contain maximum 200 characters */
title: string

/* a description that details the specific task to be accomplished. It can contain more than 500 characters */
desc: string

/* [default value "false"] a flag for whether or not we've completed the task */
isComplete: boolean

/* A date when a task was created (auto generated by the system)*/
createdAt: Date | string

/* A date for last update/modification (auto generated by the system)*/
modifiedAt: Date | string
```

## Notes:
 
 - You can preferably use Typescript as programming language.
 - You can preferably use expressJS as a web framework
 - You can preferably use mongodb as a database
 - As a bonus, you can add API documentation.
